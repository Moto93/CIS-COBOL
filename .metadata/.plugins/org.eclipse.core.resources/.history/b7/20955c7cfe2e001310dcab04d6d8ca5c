*Specifications: Write a program that that accepts input for an order of coffee and computes and displays all costs. Coffee is sold in 1 pound bags for $12 each. If a customer orders 5 pounds, they receive a 5% discount, and a 10% discount if they order 10 pounds or more. Shipping is either Ground which is $1.50 plus $0.50 per bag, or Air which is $8.00 plus $1.00 per pound. Sales tax is 6%. Tax and discounts are only applied to the coffee.

*All output must be labeled and formatted.
*All input must be echoed.
*Your program should continue to loop until all orders have been processed.
*Your program should be neat and readable with attention to naming and indentation.
*Your program must make use of at least 2 separate procedural paragraphs and your choices must make sense in regards modularity.
*All input must be validated.
