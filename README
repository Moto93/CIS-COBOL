This repo is for the Fall '13 CIS 112 COBOL Programming class. 


Hi everyone, my names Kyle, I created this repo for the purpose of having a more organized workarea and also to help benefit the class in anyway possible. Here you will find my solutions to our homeworks and also a collaborative program. This program is just for messing around purposes. Anyone can modify this in anyway. I just ask that you keep the credits in the flower box alone. Also if you do make changes to the collaborative program make sure you leave a good description as to what you did and why when you commit your work. I will fetch every commit but I'm not going to pull every commit. If you just delete stuff for no reason obviously I'm not going to pull that. 


Also, if you anyone notices I don't use NetExpress as my IDE. I currently use Visual COBOL for both Eclipse and Visual Studio. If anyone is interested in trying either of these please let me know and I can try and help with that. If you don't know what I'm talking about just continue to use NetExpress.


If anyone is interested in emailing me or needs help with anything please don't hesitate. Kyle.Colie@gmail.com
