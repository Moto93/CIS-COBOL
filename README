This repo is for the Fall '13 CIS 112 COBOL Programming class. 


Hi everyone, my names Kyle, I created this repo for the purpose of having a more organized workarea and also to help benefit the class in anyway possible. Here you will find my solutions to our homeworks and also a collaborative program.


Also, if you didn't notice, I don't use NetExpress as my IDE. I currently use Visual COBOL for both Eclipse and Visual Studio. If anyone is interested in trying either of these please let me know and I can try and help with that. If you don't know what I'm talking about just continue to use NetExpress.


If anyone is interested in emailing me or needs help with anything please don't hesitate. Kyle.Colie@gmail.com
